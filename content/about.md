##### Blog Builder
This portfolio website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), based on [Eternity](https://github.com/boratanrikulu/eternity) theme.

##### Photography
The photos of [**#ShotoniPhone**](http://localhost:1313/tags/shotoniphone/) series were shot on iPhone 11 Pro.

Most photos have been lightly edited with [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/).

##### Design
Graphic design work are done on [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/).

##### Writing
I write on my computer with Apple's native application, ["Notes"](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109) for fleeting notes.

I develop these ideas further in [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) for English articles, and [Typora](https://typora.io/) for Chinese articles. [**Click this link**](https://xdavidchen.com/) to visit the bilingual blog.
